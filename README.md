## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Irina â€“ an enthusiastic front-end developer passionate about crafting dynamic and engaging user experiences!

I'm currently working with React, JavaScript, and Redux, and I love diving into projects that push me to grow. Over the past year, I've been honing my skills not just in front-end, but also exploring the back-end with MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Mongoose, Express.js, and Next.js.

ðŸ§° Languages and Tools:

Front-end:

JavaScript
Redux
Chakra UI
CSS
HTML

Back-end:
Next.js
Express.js
Node.js (if youâ€™re comfortable with it)

Database:
MongoDB
PostgreSQL
Mongoose

I'm no stranger to Firebase, Rowy, and tools like Postman and Insomnia for testing and development workflows. Building intuitive, responsive front-end applications is where I thrive, and each new project fuels my passion for development.

Currently, I work at IBM, but I never stop learningâ€”I'm taking additional courses to expand my knowledge and stay on the cutting edge of web technologies.

Let's build something amazing together! ðŸŒŸ
